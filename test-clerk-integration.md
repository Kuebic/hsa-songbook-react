   - âœ… Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## âœ… Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: âœ… No errors
- **Vite Build**: âœ… Successful (303KB main bundle)

## ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing

The Clerk integration is now ready for testing. You can:

1. **Visit http://localhost:5173/** to see the app
2. **Test Sign Up**: Click "Sign Up" or "Create Account" 
3. **Test Sign In**: Click "Sign In" or "Get Started - Sign In"
4. **Test User Profile**: After signing in, click the user avatar
5. **Test Sign Out**: Use the UserButton dropdown to sign out
6. **Test Protected Navigation**: Songs/Setlists links only appear when signed in

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Once you've tested the basic authentication flow, we can:
- Add protected route components
- Integrate user context throughout the app  
- Connect frontend authentication to your Express backend API
- Add loading states and enhanced error handling

The foundation is solid and follows the official Clerk React + Vite integration guide exactly!
